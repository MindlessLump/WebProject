        <h4>Investigate (Area 0.1.10)</h4>
        <p>You decide to investigate more before making a potentially rash decision. The first thing you decide to do is go to the destroyed temple and see what you can find out there. You learn that a dark elf was in the temple when it was blown up, which is probably part of why the other dark elves are so angry. In addition, you find out that the explosives were built into the temple when it was constructed. This suggests that the townspeople aren't as guilty as the dark elves believe.</p>
            <p>You return to the main field surrounding the central house, where the crowd is gathered. You decide to ask around and learn more from the townspeople's side of the story. You discover that the central building is, in fact, the mayor of Bagelburg's house, and that the townspeople haven't seen the mayor in a couple days - since the dark elves came to town. You decide the best way to find out about the situation is to find the mayor - and your best guess is that he's inside his house.</p>
            <p>You and your companions go around to the back of the house, where few people are, and climb into the second floor window. As you explore the house, you run into a couple guards, and dispatch them with ease. Eventually, you find the mayor in an upstairs closet. What do you do?</p>

            Kill him, because it's easier and less complicated that way: <button type="button" onclick="location.href='0.1.20.html'">Kill</button><br>
            Go with him to the porch to confront the dark elves, bringing the issue to a head prematurely: <button type="button" onclick="location.href='0.1.11.html'">Confront</button>
