        <h4>Start (Area 0.0)</h4>
        <p>You are a halfling rogue by the name of Kheldar. Due to an unfortunate series of circumstances having to do with being a prisoner and having a companion walk with you through the rock walls, you now absolutely despise caves, as they remind you of the sensation of walking through rock. You are in this foreign land, seeking fame and fortune. Earlier today, you met an odd sorcerer, whose name you still don't know. He told you about the infestation of goblins in the nearby Fuligo Forest. In return, he promises good payment, once your mission is complete.</p>
        <p>You find yourself within sight of a small village with a tavern to the east. The road you are on continues north and south. There seems to be a figure in the distance to the north. What do you want to do?</p>
        <br>
        
        <form>
            Go north, towards the distant figure: <button type="button" onclick="location.href='0.0.10.html'">North</button><br>
            Go east, towards the village: <button type="button" onclick="location.href='0.0.20.html'">East</button><br>
            Go south, along the road: <button type="button" onclick="location.href='0.0.30.html'">South</button>
