        <p>You are a halfling rogue by the name of Kheldar. Due to an unfortunate series of circumstances having to do with being a prisoner and having a companion walk with you through the rock walls, you now absolutely despise caves, as they remind you of the sensation of walking through rock. You are in this foreign land, seeking fame and fortune.</p><br>
        <p>You find yourself within sight of a dwarven village, to the east. The road you are on continues north and south. There seems to be a figure in the distance to the north. What do you want to do?</p>
