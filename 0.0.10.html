        <p>You walk north along the road, towards the distant figure. As you approach it, you realize that it is a dwarf, with a regular-sized beard. You can't tell if it's male or female from this distance. As you get closer, you realize that it is a female dwarf. She seems unintelligent and rather lost. What do you do?</p>
