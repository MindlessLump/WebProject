        <p>You and the half-elf shoot at the goblins from afar while Bertha and the wolf smash their faces in and bite their faces off, respectively. Eventually, the last goblin fell, screaming, with an arrow protruding from its chest. The half-elf thanks you and Bertha for their timely assistance, as she and the wolf would have had a hard time on their own. After some conversation, you discover that the half-elf's name is Sootbird, and her wolf's name is Mazer. She and her wolf live alone in the forest, and she detests the &#34;goblin infestation.&#34; She tells that she knows the source of the goblins - some old ruins not far away. You decide to check it out. When you get there, you see a female human scouting out the location as well. You talk to her, and learn that her name is Paladinnia, and that she, too, is looking for the source of the goblin infestation. You all agree to work together, and enter the ruins as a group.</p>
