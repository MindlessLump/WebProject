        <h4>Talk to her (Area 0.0.11)</h4>
        <p>You talk to the lost-looking female dwarf, and you discover that she lives in a dwarven village, which must be nearby. However, she is completely lost, and has no idea how to get back home. Due to her clear lack of intelligence, you suspect that her village is actually not far up the road to the north. Whay do you do?</p>
        <br>
        
        <form>
            Walk north with her, and try to find her village: <button type="button" onclick="location.href='1.0.0.html'">North</button><br>
            Attack her, now that you know she is alone: <button type="button" onclick="location.href='2.0.0.html'">Attack</button><br>
            Try to benefit from the situation - you could use a bodyguard: <button type="button" onclick="location.href='0.0.40.html'">Benefit</button>
