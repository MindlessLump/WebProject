        <p>The next morning, you and your companions head out along the southerly road, knowing that it would soon turn east. After a long time on the road, you come upon a small village. As you enter the village, you see a large crowd of people - you estimate it to be almost everyone that lives in the village - gathered around the central building. Nearby, there is a tavern, and the other buildings seem to be houses. As you ask around, you discover that there are several dark elves shouting abuses and obsenities at the crowd. You notice that one of them is less offensive than the others and ask him what is going on. He tells you that the dark elves built a temple for their deity, but it was recently blown up. They suspect the townspeople, and wish for justice to be dispensed. What do you do?</p>
