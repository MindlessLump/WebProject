        <h4>Try to benefit from the situation - you could use a bodyguard (Area 0.0.40)</h4>
        <p>You discuss the situation with the dwarf, whose name, you now know, is Bertha. She agrees to accompany you on your mission. In return, she only asked that you pay for her food. Somewhat unaware of the hunger of dwarves, you accept. Now that Bertha is in your party, you once again focus on your main goal. You head east, towards the small village, in order to find out local information about the goblins. Because taverns are a breeding ground for gossip and news, you decide to head there first. You discover that the origin of the goblin horde seems to be some ruins deep in the heart of the forest.</p>
        <p>After a meal and a pair of rooms for the night, your purse is significantly lighter than when you went in. You begin to understand just how hungry dwarves can be. As the sun begins to peek over the horizon, you set off towards the forest. As you get deeper into the forest, though it isn't any darker, it seems more... contaminated. After struggling through thick underbrush, you suddenly come upon a clearing and see a half-elf and a huge wolf fighting several goblins. What do you do?</p>
