        <h4>Enter the ruins and find the source of the goblins (Area 0.0.60)</h4>
        <p>You, Bertha (dwarf), Sootbird(half-elf), Mazer(wolf), and Paladinnia(human) go into the ruins. You enter a small room, dimly lit, with an unfamiliar statue in the corner, and a closed door facing it. As you begin to make your way into the room, a pair of goblins burst through the door. You all stand there for a moment, stunned, and then leap into action. The two goblins are easily disposed of, and your party sustains minimal injuries. As you continue exploring, you find the odd stray goblin or two, and then reach an immense chamber with a large statue of the dwarven hero, Kalgar; you realize that the statue in the first room was of the same person. Bertha spots several goblins on the far side of the room, and you carefully explore as much of the chamber and adjacent rooms as possible before confronting the goblins. When you do, Bertha's health gets dangerously low, but she drinks a health potion you found earlier.</p>
        <p>You go through the final, large set of doors on the opposite side of the room, and find more corridors. Upon further exploration, you find a heavy door with a strong, complex lock. You try to pick the lock, but to no avail. Bertha charges at the door, trying to break in, but it's too strong. You decide to come back to it, and keep exploring. You find a broken, dilapidated bathroom, with one of the toilets missing, and a dark, unfathomable hole beneath. With no other options available to you, and needing to get to the source of the goblin infestation, you descend into the hole. It smells suprisingly good down here. You follow the narrow tunnel, and come upon a ladder at the end of the tunnel. You climb the ladder and open the grate above it.</p>
        <p>You emerge into the locked room, which seems to be a dwarven forge, with the fires still lit! Just as your whole group exits the tunnel, the forge fires flare up and a horrid smoke quickly fills the room. As you black out, you vaguely hear the door opening and see several shadows enter the room.</p>
