        <h4>Enter the ruins and find the source of the goblins (Area 0.0.60)</h4>
        <p>You, Bertha (dwarf), Sootbird(half-elf), Mazer(wolf), and Paladinnia(human) go into the ruins. You enter a small room, dimly lit, with an unfamiliar statue in the corner, and a closed door facing it. As you begin to make your way into the room, a pair of goblins burst through the door. You all stand there for a moment, stunned, and then leap into action. The two goblins are easily disposed of, and your party sustains minimal injuries. As you continue exploring, you find the odd stray goblin or two, and then reach an immense chamber with a large statue of the dwarven hero, Kalgar; you realize that the statue in the first room was of the same person. Bertha spots several goblins on the far side of the room, and you carefully explore as much of the chamber and adjacent rooms as possible before confronting the goblins. When you do, Bertha's health gets dangerously low, but she drinks a health potion you found earlier.</p>
