        <h4>Continue (Area 0.1.30)</h4>
        <p>The tavernkeeper thanks you profusely, and promises to look after the unconscious driver.  In the meantime, the situation at the dead mayor's house has escalated, and he suggests you find a way to intervene.  Having retrieved the supply wagon, you are now sure that the townspeople will be on your side, and decide to get things started.</p>
        <p>You approach the porch, but think of a better way to go about the situation.  Umlaut, who is consumate in the art of disguise, deisguises himself as the mayor, even using some of the deceased mayor's clothes.  He bursts out of the front door. Dark elves and townspeople alike are stunned. Taking advantage of his control of the situation, he quickly explains what has really been happening in the village, including the dark elves' plan to blow up the temple from the start, and the fact that they were the ones assailing the supply wagons.</p>
        <p>With their assumed mayor and a convenient group of adventurers at the lead, the townspeople swarm the dark elves on the porch. One - the more mild-mannered one you talked to previously - manages to get away, but the others are killed by the mob.  The "mayor" then proclaims the day to be a holiday to celebrate their town being saved. Hours later, after nearly eating all of the food in the saved supply wagon, you fall asleep.</p>
