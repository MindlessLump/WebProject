        <p>As you slowly and blearily come into consciousness, you see your companions sitting in a ring, yourself included, tied to chairs, with agressive-looking dwarves standing behind them. This makes you do a double take: dwarves? You thought this was an abandoned ruin, infested with goblins. Apparently, the dwarves haven't actually left. Included with your companions is the mysterious wizard that asked you to investigate the goblins in the first place. As the rest of your companions come into consciousness, a dwarf enters the room, and orders the ones behind you and your companions to bring you to Kalgar. As you walk through the corridors, you see dozens of dwarves, working at forges, running back and forth, and generally pretending to be busy, while actually sneaking covert glances at you and your companions. Then, you come upon a guarded stone room. Your guards usher you in and follow behind. A dwarf in golden armor and with an air of a man used to being listened to without hesitation, who you can only assume is Kalgar. You notice at this point that Bertha is almost peeing herself in excitement.<br><br>
        Kalgar addresses Bertha, assuming that she is in charge. He commends you on your ability to make it through the goblins upstairs with minimal injuries. He apologizes for the knockout gas, but says that it was an automatic safety measure. At this point, he begins to talk about the war his nation is currently involved in, and how none of the scouts he sent out have returned. He them proposes that, since you have already proved yourselves to be more than worthy, you go see what has been happening to his scouts. Bertha immediately agrees, but the rest of you are more hesitant, and ask what you would get out of it. Bertha says that serving Kalgar is its own reward, but Kalgar understands that that logic won't work for non-dwarves. He promises gold and other treasures upon your return, and you accept. Before you had out, he takes Bertha aside and tells her something the rest of you cannot hear. When she returns, she is positively beaming. Kalgar asks that you get some rest, and says that you will start in the morning.</p>
