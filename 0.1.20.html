        <h4>Kill him, because it's easier and less complicated that way (Area 0.1.20)</h4>
        <p>You decide to kill the mayor, because him being alive and moving about might release the impending shitstorm before you are prepared to deal with it. You leave his body in the closet and consider your options. You decide that the best option available to you would be for one of your companions to disguise as the mayor and rile up the townspeople against the elves in the way you want - but not yet. First, you decide to check out the tavern to make sure you have all the information you can get before releasing the shitstorm.</p>
        <p>At the tavern, you learn that the townspeople are especially angry, because the have to buy all of their food from the dark elves. Apparently, their own supply wagons are being lost or waylaid. The tavernkeeper suggests that protecting their supply wagons would greatly endear the townspeople to you and your companions.</p>
        <p>You ask him for the normal route that the supply wagons follow, and he tells you that they approach the town from the south, then turn west. You decide that the easiest way to make sure you find the wagons is to retrace their path backwards. As you do so, you see one coming towards you in the distance. You decide to hide in the forest and watch for an ambush, and maybe do some ambushing of your own. After several minutes with nothing, the cart enters a particularly thick bit of forest, and a pair of dark elves jump out of the trees and attack the driver!</p>
        <p>You and your companions spring into action. Bertha, Paladinnia, and Mazer run at the dark elves, while you, Umlaut, and Sootbird stand back and provide ranged support. You make quick work of the dark elves, and the driver is only unconscious when you get to him. You drive back into town on the wagon, which is filled with dozens of sacks of grain and even some dried meat. You drive up to the inn, and bring the unconscious driver in to be looked at.</p>
