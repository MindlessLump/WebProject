        <h4>Kill him, because it's easier and less complicated that way (Area 0.1.20)</h4>
        <p>You decide to kill the mayor, because him being alive and moving about might release the impending shitstorm before you are prepared to deal with it. You leave his body in the closet and consider your options. You decide that the best option available to you would be for one of your companions to disguise as the mayor and rile up the townspeople against the elves in the way you want - but not yet. First, you decide to check out the tavern to make sure you have all the information you can get before releasing the shitstorm.</p>
